## Semester project - The Pendulum Paradox
The Pendulum Paradox is Jazz Jackrabbit inspired platformer game for Android. It also utilizes multiplayer for 2 players via Google Play Game Service.

## The story
The Android Andreas Falk travel through time when suddenly his time machine starts falling apart (because of improperly tightened screws of course) and then breaks which makes him stuck in the 16th century. The only way how to get back to the future is to gather the missing parts and repair the time machine. However, the world in 16th century is not a safe place. There are tons of hostile beings that try to ruin Andrea's plan. He needs to utilize all of his skills and effort in order to survive. There are also some rummors that Andrea's friend hologram Rune crashed nearby as well. Maybe they can join forces and help each other to succeed.

## Game mode
The basic goal is to last as long as possible and get as high score as possible. One game round runs as long as all involved players are alive.

## Levels
The game contains two medieval levels. When all players finish the last level the game starts again with the first level (endless level loop).

## Score
Players can get points for killing enemies and colleting time machine parts. Scores of individual players are counted separately. The more points the better. After finishing one game round scores are sent to central highscore ladder.

## Collectables
### Time machine parts (aka coins)
The game has two different coin types. One worths 10 points (copper wheel) and the second one 20 points (gold wheel).

### Power-ups (aka enahncements)
In the levels you can also find three different kinds of powerups:
* Life powerup (red) - Permanently adds one extra life
* Defense powerup (green) - Increases defense for a short period of time
* Damage powerup (blue) - Increases damage for a short period of time

## Enemies
The game contains three different kinds of enemies:
* Smeets the Knight - aggressive guy constantly trying to kill someone with his well-forged sword. There are rummors the he has came from Netherlands.
* Tore the Ninja Boy - impatient being constantly jumping around and trying avoid work. He was born in Japan but he is not welcomed there anymore.
* Henning the Ninja - a close friend of Tore. He has issues with responding and thats why it is so hard to get in touch with him. You can often find him just running around in panic.
